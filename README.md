== CNN News Stories 

This is a demo project using Nokogiri to pull the last 5 news stories from CNN. It only displays the first paragraph of each article. The page will check for new stories every 30 seconds.

The site is live: <li><a href="http://breakingnews-demo.herokuapp.com/" target="_blank">Breaking News</a></li>. Its just a free dyno, so it will take a minute to load.


* Ruby/Rails version: 2.0/4.0.2
* PostgreSQL database
* Nokogiri

If you just want to check the news scraping from a console, there is a script available:
* /script/test_news_scraper.rb
